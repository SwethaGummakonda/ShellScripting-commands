Moving Around the FileSystem :
pwd: Print working directory 
cd : cd command allows you to change the directory. 
      To navigate into the root directory, use cd / 
      To navigate to your home directory, use cd
      To navigate up one directory level, use cd ..
      To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use cd - 

Manipulating Files and Folders:
cp: The cp command makes a copy of a file for you. 
For example, cp file foo makes an exact copy of the file whose name you entered and names the copy foo.
mv: The mv command moves a file to a different location or renames a file.
Examples are as follows: mv file foo renames the original file to foo.
